## Section 4: Features

### i. Features on the Website

Screen shots of the features

### ii. Features to be implemented in the future
I was being too ambitious with the idea of having 6 pages with 3 separate recipe pages. Time constraints and early stage of developing, I had to reduce it down to the standard 3 pages assigned for the project.
I applied a similar format to the Love Running project with a gallery page as my second page. 
The individual recipes pages will have to be a feature for the future, expanding on from this original website.

(use bullet points for features you want in the future e.g. recorded videos of online lessons already held)
Actual recipes like on my weebly website (with screenshots of my weebly website’s recipes or add pdf link and screen shot of a recipe).
